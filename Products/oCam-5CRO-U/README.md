The oCam supports plug-and-play by UVC compliant adapting the standard M12 lens with focal length of 3.6mm.</br>
Direct memory access via USB 3.0 allows data to be written to main memory without going through the CPU. It reduces the CPU work load significantly.</br></br>
The newly released oCam-5CRO-U is an enhanced version of oCam-5CR-U3 with the following new features.
* Improved hardware stability with the single board design
* Plastic protective case is provided without any additional cost
* The USB connector is moved to back side for easier connection to host system. With the protective case this new vertical USB connector makes it easy to put the camera anywhere in a vertical orientation without any additional fixture or jig
